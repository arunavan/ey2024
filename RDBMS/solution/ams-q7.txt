Write a query to display the average cost of the tickets in each flight on all scheduled dates. The query should display flight_id, from_location, to_location and Average price as "Price". 
Display the records sorted in ascending order based on flight id and then by from_location and then by to_location.

Solution:
select af.flight_id,af.from_location,af.to_location,avg(afd.price) 
from air_flight af join air_flight_details afd 
on af.flight_id=afd.flight_id 
group by af.flight_id,af.from_location,af.to_location 
order by af.flight_id,af.from_location,af.to_location;
