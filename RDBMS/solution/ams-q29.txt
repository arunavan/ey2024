Display the records sorted in ascending order based on flight id and then by No_of_Seats_Booked.

Solution:
select af.flight_id,af.from_location,af.to_location,af.total_seats,
(af.total_seats-afd.available_seats) as No_of_Seats_Booked 
from air_flight af join air_flight_details afd on af.flight_id= 
afd.flight_id 
where (af.total_seats-afd.available_seats)>(af.total_seats*0.1) 
group by flight_id 
order by flight_id,No_of_Seats_Booked;
