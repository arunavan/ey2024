select af.flight_id,af.from_location,af.to_location,
count(afd.flight_departure_date) as No_of_Services, avg(afd.price) as Average_Price 
from air_flight af join air_flight_details afd on af.flight_id=afd.flight_id 
group by af.flight_id 
having avg(afd.price)> (select avg(afd.price) 
			from air_flight_details afd) 
order by afd.price;
